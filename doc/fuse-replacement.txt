== Battery-connected Hoymiles HM-350 ==


The HM350 is fed from a 51.2V 16S LFP battery

THe HM350 Vin- is connected directly to the battery V-

The HM350 Vin+ is connected to battery V+ via a series
fuse and bypass'able high power resistor as follows:

 HM350_Vin-                                        LFP_V-
   |                                                 |

== Power-up sequence and/or fuse replacement ==

1) Disconnect the AC line of HM350

2) Remove the bypass cable

3) Replace the failed 15A fuse

4) Wait for the HM350 to charge up to battery voltage
   via the series 10W resistor

5) HM350 should be blinking red, waiting for AC

6) Add the bypass cable back in,
   bypassing the resistor

7) Reconnect the AC line of HM350

8) Wait for HM350 to start blinking green


Details:

The HM350 has a high inrush current when initially connected
to a DC input voltage. An LFP battery can support extremely
high currents of >50A and this could vaporize circuit board
traces on the HM350.

To avoid the inrush current the HM350 DC input must be brought
up to battery voltage via the 5.6 Ohm 10W series resistor first.

The choice of resistance is due to maximum LFP voltage (~55V)
and maximum HM350 input current (~10A); 55V / 10A ~= 5.6 ohm

The HM350 AC output must be off/disconnected (blinking red),
otherwise the HM350 might be start producing (blinking green)
from battery - leading to several volts of voltage drop across
the series resistor i.e. HM350 sees a much lower DC voltage
than the battery voltage, the bypass cable cannot be inserted
without burning the fuse, and the resistor heats up excessively.
